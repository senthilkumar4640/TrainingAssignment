        <p>Multiple entry modes
            Two different entry modes keep the experience fresh and help develop different speed typing skills.
            
            Text lookahead 100% of the time
            At any point in time both entry modes provide, at a minimum, the next 2-3 words (21 characters to be precise) so you can always be looking ahead at the next words to type - a useful skill in learning to type faster.
            
            Broad range of test round times
            Why should you always have to take a 1 minute typing test?
            
            Speed Typing Online provides six different test round times: 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minute, 3 minute, 5 minute, and 10 minute typing tests.
            
            Type what you're typing!
            Tired of having to frantically check back and forth between the text to type and what you're typing?
            
            Both entry modes combine the two into one, so you are always looking at exactly what you are typing on screen as you do normally, making it easy to refine your natural typing skill.</p>
